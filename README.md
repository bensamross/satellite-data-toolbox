# raster-data-collection

The three primary sources of satellite data used in this code comes from Landsat, Sentinel-2, and Worldview. These are used because they are free and very accessible. All three tools have been bundled together here so that by specifying one area of interest you can extract data from these 3x datastores simultaneously.
