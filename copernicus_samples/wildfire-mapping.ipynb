    "As locations with forest fire often have cloud cover, which hinders the calculation of forest fire-affected areas, we want to get a cloud-free pre-event datacube. Thus, let us define a simple Python function to pre-process pre-event NDVI. Here we use the concept of BAP which means the best available cloud-free pixels right before or right after the forest fire event, this is obtained via cloud masking and temporal reduction with “first” in post event datacube and “last” in pre event datacube.ent date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence: * We first create a cloud mask with an SCL band where we filter out pixels which have a cloud effect; * Subsequently, a Gaussian kernel is created since the cloud masks are frequently noisy and may not completely encompass the cloud region; * Next, we apply a smoothing function to the selected mask coupled with a morphometric dilation to increase and smooth the mask area. Here, for dilation, we select 11 pixels; * Following this, a binary mask is produced by applying a threshold of 0.1. This implies that to be classified as cloud-free pixels, the pixels that have undergone smoothing and dilation should exhibit a value below 0.1. * Once the required mask is generated, it is applied to the data cube; * Finally, once the masked datacube is available, we want to select each cloud-free pixel as near the forest fire date as possible. To achieve this, we reduce the time dimension (reduce_dimension) based on the “last” criterion, which selects the nearest cloud-free pixel to the event date."
