statistics\n","\n","EOdal makes use of the [rasterstats](https://pythonhosted.org/rasterstats/) package to calculate zonal statistics. The cool thing about `rasterstats` is its ability to take custom functions as an input for calculating user-defined statistical metrics. This means, users will have a lot of freedom choicing the metrics most suited to their needs.\n","\n","Below you find two examples of such custom functions. There are two important things to consider when writing user-defined functions:\n","\n","1. the *function name* should be unique and not have the same name as any existing numpy function. Therefore, using a prefix such as `my_` might be helpful.\n","2. the *function should return a single scalar* as this is the definition of doing zonal statistics. *N* raster cells overlapping a geometry are aggregated by the function into a single value.\n","\n","The two functions below calculate the `median absolute deviation` and the `sum of the square` of the raster cell values. This has no deeper meaning and is just to show how such custom functions should be designed."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"id":"2c82618d-f5b8-4f9a-a247-e9f21d67108c","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"2c82618d-f5b8-4f9a-a247-e9f21d67108c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754696366867,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"N","userId":"00433264768087294221"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def my_median_abs_deviation(x: np.ma.MaskedArray) -> float:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Custom function to calculate the median absolute\n","    deviation in `eodal.scene.get_feature_timeseries()`.\n","\n","    :param x:\n","        array with raster values\n","    :returns:\n","        median absolute deviation value\n","    \"\"\"\n","    x = x.filled(np.nan)\n","    return median_abs_deviation(x, nan_policy='omit', axis=None)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"id":"de6ef9a3-a57a-4ed0-bc07-40e455f8caa4","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"de6ef9a3-a57a-4ed0-bc07-40e455f8caa4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754696381990,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":43,"user":{"displayName":"N","userId":"00433264768087294221"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def my_square_sum(x: np.ma.MaskedArray) -> float:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Custom function returning sum(x**2)\n","\n","    :param x:\n","        array with raster values\n","    :returns:\n","        median absolute deviation value\n","    \"\"\"\n","    x = x.filled(np.nan)\n","    # important: the sum of nan is zero!\n","    if np.isnan(x).all():\n","        return np.nan\n","    return np.nansum(x*x)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"86526e1e-0e53-4512-86ff-9bbc3d96686a","metadata":{"id":"86526e1e-0e53-4512-86ff-9bbc3d96686a"},"source":["### Getting the Sentinel-2 Data\n","\n","This part of the notebook is essentially the same as in the [EOdal mapper notebook](../General/EOdal_Mapper.ipynb).
